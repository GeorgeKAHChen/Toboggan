By KazukiAmakawa<br/>

## Instruction
Toboggan Contrast Algorithm is a kind of image algorithm which can segmentation images. Althrough the algorithm always overfitting, it can combine pixel as node. The basic fundamental of algorithm is given in [1]. And this package is just the establishment of all the algorithm.<br/>

## Usage
void
